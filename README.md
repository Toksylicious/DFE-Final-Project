# DFE-Final-Project

o	Why are we doing this?
The purpose of this project is to build a Spring boot Api called,called EmployeeApp, to supports an HR manager of a technology company in their daily work. 
The application supports the HR manager to interact with the server via a mobile application. Through the mobile app, the HR manager and members of their team can track 
employee database of the organisation and update the database with leavers and joiners.
The application is built utilising an application backend developed using Java programming language with the employee database hosted locally on MySQL and H2.The services
of Postman was used to check persistence of the API with MySQL workbench in the development environment and testned using JUnit and once the test was passed, the 
application was built using Maven and merged into the main branch.

o	How I expected the challenge to go.
I didnt expect the challenge to be this daunting, when I saw the project specification at first, I thought I was not going to be able to understand but after the revision 
with our Tutor and going over the course materials, I was able to gain full understanding of how APIs are built using Spring Boot.

o	What went well? / What didn't go as planned?
Time constraint was a major negative for me because I had to go through this bootcamp and project work whilst also writing my dissertation and such my time was divided 
between the two very important projects and in order for me to achieve success, I had to work late into the early hours of the mornings on most days to complete my work.
The upside was the excellent tutoring and the available course materials and class recordings, they really helped.

o	Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
I will think of other ways to improve the project by adding other features the application might automate the HR process.

o	Screenshots showing your postman requests and the output from the API.
The screenshots can be found as word and pdf documents in a named(Screen shots) saved in the documentation folder of the project in GitHub.

o	Screenshots of your database to prove that data is being persisted.
